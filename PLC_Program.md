# ðŸ§© PLC Program Overview

This appendix includes a high-level description of the ladder logic used in our Siemens S7-1200 PLC during the IT/OT convergence project.

## System Overview

The PLC was programmed using Siemens TIA Portal and was designed to simulate a bottling line automation process, including:

- Start/stop control logic
- Timer-controlled sequences
- Interlocking for safety logic
- HMI control via Simatic panel

## Key Components

- Inputs: Start button, Stop button, Limit switches
- Outputs: Conveyor motors, Solenoids, Indicator lights
- HMI Integration: Screen toggles, status readouts, and manual override controls

## Challenges

- Learning TIA Portalâ€™s interface and programming model
- Debugging ladder logic and ensuring real-world behavior simulation
- Integrating with the network for remote control/monitoring
